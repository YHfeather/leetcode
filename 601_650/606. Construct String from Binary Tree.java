//You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.

//The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

//example: input:[1,2,3,4]    output:"1(2(4))(3)"
//example: input:[1,2,3,null,4]    output:"1(2()(4))(3)"
